This program will take in the user maze of choice when they run the program and then first it will do an error check to see if the 
maze is valid or the user didn't enter in a maze by calling the error function. Then if the test is pass then it will call the run 
function that will start running the program and the run function will first call the read in function. The read in function will read
in the chosen maze file the user choose and then call the dynamic allocate function to create space for the data in the structure that 
have a 2D array. When the read in finish reading in the data the run fucntion will call wall follower function that will then solve the 
maze for the user. The wall follower will first check where the user starting out at in the maze with a check function then run the 
move function which will move the user base on what direction the are in. Then it will loop until the user have reach the exit of the maze 
then it will return back to the run function. The run function will now print out the solution to the user the path that the user need to
will be represented by W.
